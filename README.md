Monitor liked songs and sort them in playlists automatically.

## Run locally in development mode

Running `docker compose up` without specifying the file will automatically take the `docker-compose.override.yml` into account:

    docker compose up -d --build
    docker compose down

Once started, you can access the application at <http://localhost:8090>.
